# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! 

You can contribute by either creating a pull request or by filing an [issue][is] on the issue tracker. In general, try and keep to one suggested change per pull request/issue. It's easier to work with a series of many small suggested changes rather then one large suggested change.

When suggesting a new resource or link to add, be sure to...

1. Include a link to the resources and a brief description or annotation.
2. Make sure the resource is high-quality
3. Try and avoid overlap or too much redundancy between existing resources.

The goal of this collection is to create an annotated list of high-quality resources suitable for beginners or people wanting to improve their skill in an existing category. This collection is **not** meant to be an exhaustive list of every single possible resource, since that might be overwhelming for beginners. 

In addition, if you feel that two existing resources are very similar and that having both of them adds no value, or if one resource is too low-quality, please open a discussion on the issue tracker.
