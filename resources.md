## Introduction

This page is meant to start as a **curated** list of resources for getting started in various programming languages and technologies. It doesn't try and list every single resource available, and instead links resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- Python (general-purpose)
- Java (general-purpose; Android development)
- HTML/CSS/Javascript (websites and webapps)

### Warning 

This page is still a work-in-progress! Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted. 

Any contributions are welcome! To suggest a change, either make a pull request or submit an issue using the issue tracker to the right.


## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).

You can also find a meta "list of programming resources" aggregator here: http://resrc.io/


### Online courses

This is an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to help guide the next generation of programmers, and as such, new resources like this are popping up all the time. Feel free to contribute new offerings to this section as they form.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts, including reddit co-founder Steve Huffman.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above.
- [MIT's OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - static course materials taught at MIT.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - contains a wide variety of courses in addition to computer science.
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx) - static course materials taught at Stanford.

Redditors have also been known to teach courses on a variety of topics, including programming, at /r/universityofreddit. Check out [the computer science section](http://ureddit.com/category/23442/computer-science).  Just like with anything on reddit, since anyone can contribute, these courses may vary in quality from professor to "professor".

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but frequently require payment.

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) - focuses on web and iOS development.
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/) - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.

## Programming Languages

### C

Unfortunately, there are very few good online resources for beginners on C, free or otherwise. You may be able to find a course on any of the above interactive online courses that happens to teach C, but you're typically better off finding a book.


- Online courses: N/A
- Interactive tutorials:
    - [Learn-C](http://learn-c.org) - an interactive online guide that teaches you basic C step-by-step.
- Exercises: N/A
- Video tutorials: N/A

### C++

Similarly to C, there are very few good online resources for beginners on C++. 

Note: while C++ is technically a superset of C and while most C code is also valid C++ code, the differences in how you write idiomatic C and C++ code are so different that they're practically different programming languages. Do not assume that just because you know C you can proficiently programming in C++, and vice-versa.

### C-Sharp

C# is a language made by Microsoft, and is often described as being very similar to Java.

Despite its name, C# has very little to do with C and C++. See our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_the_difference_between_c.2C_c.2B.2B.2C_objective-c.2C_and_c.23.3F) for more info.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the core three languages that you need to know in order to make websites. HTML is used to dictate the _structure_ and _content_ of your website. CSS is used to make your HTML look nice, adding _style_ and _layout_. Javascript is used to add _interactivity_ to your website.

It's important to note that HTML and CSS are both not considered programming languages and so will feel very different from Javascript. Nevertheless, all three are still very useful to know.

The recommending learning order is HTML, followed shortly after by CSS, then Javascript once you've learned HTML+CSS.
