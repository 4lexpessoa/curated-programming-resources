# Curated Programming Resources

## Introduction

This page is meant to start as a **curated** list of resources for getting started in various programming languages and technologies. It doesn't try and list every single resource available, and instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)
- [Java](#java) (general-purpose; Android development)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)
- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)

Python and Java are both languages that are [commonly used to teach programming](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) to beginners in schools and universities, and so will have a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also both widely used in the industry and so are useful languages to have in your toolbelt.

Web development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It also requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.

Scratch is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together "blocks" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children (elementary schoolers, middle schoolers) or for people who dislike typing.

### Warning

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).

You can also find a meta "list of programming resources" aggregator here: http://resrc.io/


### Online courses

This is an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to help guide the next generation of programmers, and as such, new resources like this are popping up all the time.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx) - static course materials taught at Stanford.

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) - focuses on web and iOS development.
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/) - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.

(See [PHP: a fractal of bad design](http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)). If you do decide to learn PHP, just be aware of the fact that people will probably make fun of you at one point or another. If you're ok with that, more power to you.

### Scratch

Scratch is a language wherein you create programs by dragging together and connecting "blocks". Unlike other programming languages, Scratch is very visual, making it a very good first programming language, especially for children and younger teens. 

Because not many people may be familiar with Scratch, this section will contain resources that are helpful both for _learning_ Scratch, and _teaching_ Scratch.
